## Notes on local information

Have a look into the PDF file **local_info_example.pdf** to see how the pre-processing of environment information
retrieval is done. 

**Note:** At the current stage, the pre-processing is done only for meshes M1, M2 and M3. One may want 
to automate this step in future works.
